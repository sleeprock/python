## Running SQL Queries Programmatically

DataFrames can easily be manipulated using SQL queries in PySpark. The sql() function on a SparkSession enables applications to run SQL queries programmatically and returns the result as another DataFrame. In this exercise, you'll create a temporary table of the people_df DataFrame that you created previously, then construct a query to select the names of the people from the temporary table and assign the result to a new DataFrame.

```python
# Create a temporary table "people"
people_df.createOrReplaceTempView("people")

# Construct a query to select the names of the people from the temporary table "people"
query = '''select name from people'''

# Assign the result of Spark's query to people_df_names
people_df_names = spark.sql(query)

# Print the top 10 names of the people
people_df_names.show(10)
```

## SQL queries for filtering Table

In the previous exercise, you have run a simple SQL query on a DataFrame. There are more sophisticated queries you can construct to obtain the result that you want and use it for downstream analysis such as data visualization and Machine Learning. In this exercise, we will use the temporary table people that you created previously and filter out the rows where the "sex" is male and female and create two DataFrames.

```python
# Filter the people table to select female sex 
people_female_df = spark.sql('SELECT * FROM people WHERE sex=="female"')

# Filter the people table DataFrame to select male sex
people_male_df = spark.sql('SELECT * FROM people WHERE sex=="male"')

# Count the number of rows in both DataFrames
print("There are {} rows in the people_female_df and {} rows in the people_male_df DataFrames".format(people_female_df.count(), people_male_df.count()))
```
